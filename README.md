# OS-Scheduling-Algorithms-

CPU Scheduling algorithms visualization created with java swing.
Desktop based GUI application to effectively learn and visulize all CPU scheduling algorithms in a Operating system.

** For complete details and instruction to use jar file refer https://github.com/Divam-bot/OS-Scheduling-Algorithms-/blob/main/Implementation%20%26%20Theory.pdf **
** To install or modify project refer https://github.com/Divam-bot/OS-Scheduling-Algorithms-/blob/main/ReadMe.pdf **
** To watch complete usage of vizualization on all algorithms: https://youtu.be/m-a8-nxlg38/ ** 

Visualization of following algoritms are included

1. First Come First Serve
2. Shortest Job First
3. Longest Job First
4. Round Robin
5. Shortest Remaining Time First
6. Longest Remaining Time First
7. Priority Scheduling
8. Pre-emptive Priority

At each second which process is at which stage inside CPU can be visulized

Additionally it also generated graphs and gant chart to compare effeciency of different algorithms for a given scenerio
